You need to create a REST service that can fetch bank details, using the data given in the APIâ€™s query parameters.

You can use the data available in this [repository](https://github.com/snarayanank2/indian_banks) in your backend DB. Write your service in any language of your choice. Host it on Heroku - you can sign up for a free account in Heroku. E.g. [Here are steps](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-python) on how you can get a Django app running in Heroku in a few minutes. Please use PostgreSQL as your backend DB. Since the free-tier of Heroku has a limit of 10k rows, you can use another DB provider (eg: you can use [clever-cloud.com](https://www.clever-cloud.com/) to host your Postgres DB by [following steps](https://www.clever-cloud.com/doc/addons/clever-cloud-addons/)).

Essentials your applications should have:

1. Autocomplete API to return possible matches based on the branch name **ordered by IFSC code** (ascending order) with limit and offset.
    1. **Endpoint: /api/branches/autocomplete?q=<>**
    2. Example: /api/branches/autocomplete?q=**RTGS**&limit=3&offset=0
    3. Sample response:

    ```json
    {
       "branches":[
          {
             "ifsc":"ABHY0065001",
             "bank_id":60,
             "branch":"RTGS-HO",
             "address":"ABHYUDAYA BANK BLDG., B.NO.71, NEHRU NAGAR, KURLA (E), MUMBAI-400024",
             "city":"MUMBAI",
             "district":"GREATER MUMBAI",
             "state":"MAHARASHTRA"
          },
          {
             "ifsc":"ABNA0000001",
             "bank_id":110,
             "branch":"RTGS-HO",
             "address": "414 EMPIRE COMPLEX, SENAPATI BAPAT MARG LOWER PAREL WEST MUMBAI 400013",
             "city":"MUMBAI",
             "district":"GREATER BOMBAY",
             "state":"MAHARASHTRA"
          },
          {
             "ifsc":"ADCB0000001",
             "bank_id":143,
             "branch":"RTGS-HO",
             "address":"75, REHMAT MANZIL, V. N. ROAD, CURCHGATE, MUMBAI - 400020",
             "city":"MUMBAI",
             "district":"MUMBAI CITY",
             "state":"MAHARASHTRA"
          },
          {
             "ifsc":"ADCC0000001",
             "bank_id":61,
             "branch":"RTGS-HO",
             "address": "THE AKOLA DISTRICT CENTRAL COOP. BANK LTD., P.B.NO. 8, CIVIL LINES, S.A. COLLEGE ROAD, AKOLA. 444001",
             "city":"AKOLA",
             "district":"AKOLA",
             "state":"MAHARASHTRA"
          }
       ]
    }
    ```

2. Search API to return possible matches across all columns and all rows, **ordered by IFSC code** (ascending order) with limit and offset.

1. **Endpoint: /api/branches?q=<>**
2. Example: /api/branches?q=**Bangalore**&limit=4&offset=0
3. Sample response:

```json
{
   "branches":[
      {
         "ifsc":"ABNA0100318",
         "bank_id":110,
         "branch":"BANGALORE",
         "address":"PRESTIGE TOWERS', GROUND FLOOR, 99 & 100, RESIDENCY ROAD, BANGALORE 560 025.",
         "city":"BANGALORE",
         "district":"BANGALORE URBAN",
         "state":"KARNATAKA"
      },
      {
